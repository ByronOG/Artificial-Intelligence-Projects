# Artificial-Intelligence-Projects
A collection of Homework projects from my AI class at SJSU (CS 156)

# HW2: Advanced Functions
Implemented functions analysing a game state using generator expressions.

# HW3: Uninformed Search Algorithms #
Implemented DFS, BFS, and UCS search algorithms

# HW4: Informed Search ALgorithms #
Implemented A* algorithm. Paired A* with different heuristics such as a null heuristic to more advanced heuristics which analysed the game state

# HW5: Constraint Satisfaction Problem #
Represented a game of sudoku as a CSP by building domains, neighbours, and constraints.

# HW6: Adversial Search
Implemented minimax algorithms, such as alpha-beta pruning minimax and alpha-beta, depth-limited minimax.
